## Experience

### ⭐ 2016 - 2019 ⭐

Almost a decade ago a program called RPGMaker VX got me hooked into games creation. I started with a couple of story driven, never published pixel titles. After that I started studying about the actual coding, what led me to C# and Unity. There I've managed to create my first official title - Slaughterman, and publish it on google playstore (after some time it was eventually taken down  bcs I didn't update some required data).

Almost a decade ago, a program called RPGMaker VX pulled me into game creation. I began with a few story-driven, never published pixel projects. Eventually got interest in actual programming, which led me to C# and Unity, where I developed and published my first official title — Slaughterman (later removed from Google Play due to outdated metadata).


### ⭐ 2019 - 2021 - GLITCHPUNK ⭐

Slaughterman helped me find my first employer and mentor, who taught me all the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 4, quickly became my main framework. Together we shipped the first big title on my journey - Glitchpunk, a dystopian top-down, story driven, action game. It didn’t reach a large audience, but it taught me a lot while working on:
<p></p>

- Gameplay systems: Weapon, spawning, upgrades, hacking, vehicle upgrades systems
- AI (BTs, EQS, Perception, Nav invokers)
- UI and Dialogue system
- Save/load system
- 2D animation state machine
- Localization


### ⭐ 2021 - 2024 - SILENT HILL 2 REMAKE ⭐
<img src="https://github.com/Herniac/Herniac/blob/main/Silenthill.gif"/>
After Glitchpunk's early access launch, I joined to Bloober Team, where I had an honor of working on the remake of a timeless masterpiece horror. During this time I started learning C++. which was a major improvement in my career. My main tasks included:
<p></p>

- AI for bosses (Flesh Lip & Abstract Daddy) and regular enemies (Creeper & Mandarins) using behavior trees
- Minor gameplay systems (bossfight managers, DPS counting component)
- Smaller tasks involving Animation blueprints and Physics Assets
- Hit Reaction System
- Profiling with Unreal Insights
- Nav filters and nav modifiers


### ⭐ 2024 - 2025 - CRONOS THE NEW DAWN ⭐
<img src="https://github.com/Herniac/Herniac/blob/main/Cronos.gif"/>
During this short but intense period I supported the final stagest of Cronos development. I worked on tasks drawing from my previous experience and also expanded my knowledge about the engine such as:
<p></p>

- AI for enemies using Gameplay Tasks
- Smart Objects system for enemies
- Dismemberment system
- Hit reaction system
- Extended movement and lying state for enemies
- GAS-based actor components
- Unreal Engine Subsystem class
- World Partition
- Functional Tests (FTests)


### ⭐ 2025 - ? ⭐

As my journey continues, I am currently working on a promising (yet unrevealed) title, so I can't disclose any details for now.
